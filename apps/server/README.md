### Tools used
- `NestJS`
- `TypeORM` - For database operations, as ORM
- `PostgreSQL`
- `Passport`, `passport-jwt`, `passport-local` - for authentication strategies
- `typeorm-seeding` - For seed factories and seeders
- `False` - For fake data in seeders

### Before Running this application
0. Run `yarn` at the top level of this project.
1. Create a `.env` file and use the `.env.example` file to get a reference of values. You may need to create a cloudinary account. It's free :)
2. In `server/`, run `docker compose up -d` if you want to use the docker compose included in this project. For now, only the database runs in docker.
3. Run `yarn start:dev` to start in dev mode.

### Modules

There are 4 modules in this project:
- `Allergy` - Contains controllers, services, DTOs, entities, for allergy
- `User` - Contains controllers, services, DTOs, entities, for user
- `Cloudinary` - Contains cloudinary service to upload photos to cloudinary
- `Auth` - Contains all things related to authentication. Read more [here](./src/modules/auth/README.md)

### Nest CLI generators

This project has a slightly different structure, instead of having all modules in `src/`, all modules are inside the `modules/` directory.

To genereate modules, providers, services, controllers, inside the server directory, run:

```bash
nest g controller/service/provider/module modules/<module name>
```

Adding `modules/` infront of the modules name ensures that all generated modules are inside the modules/ directory.

### Generic Crud Controllers and Services

In this project, inside `common/crud`, there are generic crud controllers and services. The `crud.service.ts`, is a generic service and the `crud.controller.ts` is a generic controller class.

These generics can be used to build services and controllers for a module easily.

#### Note: Generic controllers and services may not fulfil all your needs. These only contain basic CRUD operations and in many cases you may find yourself having to override them or not using generics at all. Also, Generic controllers will not be able to generate DTOs in swagger, and you will have to overwrite the controllers to include the swagger decorators, the reason is that decorator information is lost in runtime for swagger.

#### Usage:

##### Crud service

You can use the generic crud service as follows:

First create the service file. For eg: user.service.ts

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class UserService extends CrudService<User> {
  constructor(
    @InjectRepository(User)
    private userRepository: Repository<User>,
  ) {
    super(userRepository);
  }

  // other service methods/overrides
}
```


#### Crud Controller

You can use the generic crud controller as follows:

First create the controller file. For eg: user.controller.ts

```typescript
@Controller('users')
@ApiTags('users')
export class UserController extends CrudController<User> {
  constructor(
    private userService: UserService,
  ) {
    super(userService);
  }
  // this will generate a controller with predefined routes for the resource
  // you can add/override other controllers here
}
```

### Migrations and Seeds

There are two scripts for migration in `package.json`.
- To generate a migration:
```bash
yarn migration:generate migration/<your_migration_name>
```

- To run migrations:
```bash
yarn migration:run
```

- To run seeders:
```bash
yarn seed:run
```

To add more seeders, see [typeorm-seeding](https://github.com/w3tecch/typeorm-seeding). Note that the faker package has been replaced by `falso` in this project. For reference, see: `src/database`.
